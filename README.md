- 👋 Hi, I’m @begin2791, because I am totally beginner in programming science. I hate disrespectful people who violate the privacy of others and try to discriminate based on having greater knowledge in an area. That is almost a hate crime and the people who do it are sick.
- 👀 I’m interested in make friends that can help me to learn more about this beautiful art. Programming is fun, I can spend hours on it, but I still have a lot to learn. Clearly I need help. I hope in the midst of that bunch of scoffers there is someone benevolent here.
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to improve my python skills, but I have other things to do because I studied formally chemistry, so I need yet many many hours of dedication in orden to improve. It would be good finding a true friend that can help me.
- 💞️ In this moment I don't want try collaborative work. Maybe later. I want to say a last thing. I am a sick person, and I have physical documents to prove it. Also I always try to be carefult in that related to my computer use, in order to do things legally. If someone bothers me for no reason I will report it.
- 📫 Finally.I hope make good friends and and keep insolent and racist hackers(motherfuckers) away ...
